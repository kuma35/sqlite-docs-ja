"rollback journal is ever written if journal mode is set to OFF.  The OFF "
"journal mode disables the atomic commit and rollback capabilities of "
"SQLite.  The ROLLBACK command is not available when OFF journal mode is "

"that uses the OFF journal mode, no recovery is possible and the database "

"journal to be stored in memory rather than on disk.  The ROLLBACK command "
"still works when the journal mode is MEMORY, but because no file exists on "
