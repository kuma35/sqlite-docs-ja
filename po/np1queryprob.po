"Following the single big \"timeline\" query, there are additional queries "

"than trying to grab all the information in as few queries as possible.  But "
"that is ok because there is no unnecessary IPC overhead.  At the bottom of "
"each timeline page, Fossil shows approximately how long it took to generate "
"the page.  For a 50-entry timeline, the latency is usually less than 25 "
"milliseconds.  Profiling shows that few of those milliseconds were spent "

"Using the N+1 Query pattern in Fossil does not harm the application.  But "
"the N+1 Query pattern does have benefits.  For one, the section of the code "
"that creates the timeline query can be completely separate from the section "
"that prepares each timeline entry for display.  This provides a separation "
"of responsibility that helps keep the code simple and easy to maintain.  "
"Secondly, the information needed for display, and the queries needed to "
"extract that information, vary according to what type of objects to be "
"shown.  Check-ins need one set of queries.  Tickets need another set of "
"queries.  Wiki pages need a different query.  And so forth.  By implementing "
"these queries on-demand and in the part of the code dealing with the various "
"entities, there is further separation of responsibility and simplification "
