"Users of the SQLite library, particularly application developers, who want "
"to access a SQLite database from different systems connected by a network "
"are often tempted to simply open a <a href=\"c3ref/sqlite3.html\">database "
"connection</a> by specifying a filename which references a database file "
"somewhere within a network filesystem. (\"remote database\" here)  This "
"\"file\" is then accessed by means of OS API's which permit the illusion of "
"I/O from/to a local file.  The illusion is good but imperfect in important "
"ways."

"The \"API Call\" channel carries less information than the \"File I/O\" "

"require substantially fewer bits to be passed back and forth than are "

"The API Call channel operates at processor main memory speeds "

"When the File I/O channel includes a network connection, (in addition to "

"where raw transfer rate does not limit bandwidth, the traffic must still be "
"packetized and buffered at both ends.  Additional layers of I/O handlers add "
"scheduling delays.  However, slowed transfers are the least significant "

"The \"File I/O\" channel, when it directly reaches a local storage device, "

"critical for enabling database management software to be designed to ensure "
"<a href=\"transactional.html\">ACID</a> behavior: When all process writes to "

"When network filesystem apparatus and software layers are interposed between "

"network data transfers are error-checked well, transfer packets do not all "
"reliably arrive at their destination once sent.  Some packets are clobbered "
"by other packets and must be resent.  Under packet clobbering conditions, "
"repeated retries can impose delays exceeding what is needed for similar data "

"Because of the disordering and outright data loss which occur in network "
"filesystem writes, it is critical that sets of file writes can be accurately "
"known to be done before a subsequent set of file writes begins.  This "
"assurance is obtained by use of robustly designed and correctly implemented "
"fsync() (or equivalent) OS functions.  Unfortunately for some applications, "
"network filesystem sync operation can be less robust than local filesystem "
"sync.  Attaining robust sync in the face of network packet transport errors "

"A similar hazard arises with file locking in network filesystems.  SQLite "
