"<b>Maximum Number Of Pages In A Database File</b> SQLite is able to limit "
"the size of a database file to prevent the database file from growing too "
"large and consuming too much disk space.  The SQLITE_MAX_PAGE_COUNT "
"parameter, which is normally set to 1073741823, is the maximum number of "
"pages allowed in a single database file.  An attempt to insert new data that "
"would cause the database file to grow larger than this will return "
"SQLITE_FULL.  The largest possible setting for SQLITE_MAX_PAGE_COUNT is "
"4294967294.  When used with the maximum page size of 65536, this gives a "
"maximum SQLite database size of about 281 terabytes.  The <a "
"href=\"pragma.html#pragma_max_page_count\"> max_page_count PRAGMA</a> can be "
"used to raise or lower this limit at run-time."

"<b>Maximum Number Of Rows In A Table</b> The theoretical maximum number of "
"rows in a table is 2<sup><small>64</small></sup> (18446744073709551616 or "
"about 1.8e+19).  This limit is unreachable since the maximum database size "
"of 281 terabytes will be reached first.  A 281 terabytes database can hold "
"no more than approximately 2e+13 rows, and then only if there are no indices "
"and if each row contains very little data."

"<b>Maximum Database Size</b> Every database consists of one or more "
"\"pages\".  Within a single database, every page is the same size, but "
"different databases can have page sizes that are powers of two between 512 "
"and 65536, inclusive.  The maximum size of a database file is 4294967294 "
"pages.  At the maximum page size of 65536 bytes, this translates into a "
"maximum database size of approximately 1.4e+14 bytes (281 terabytes, or 256 "
"tebibytes, or 281474 gigabytes or 256,000 gibibytes).  This particular upper "
"bound is untested since the developers do not have access to hardware "
"capable of reaching this limit.  However, tests do verify that SQLite "
"behaves correctly and sanely when a database reaches the maximum file size "
"of the underlying filesystem (which is usually much less than the maximum "
"theoretical database size) and when a database is unable to grow due to disk "
"space exhaustion."

"<b>Maximum Number Of Tables In A Schema</b> Each table and index requires at "
"least one page in the database file.  An \"index\" in the previous sentence "
"means an index created explicitly using a <a "
"href=\"lang_createindex.html\">CREATE INDEX</a> statement or implicit "
"indices created by UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints.  Since the maximum "
"number of pages in a database file is 2147483646 (a little over 2 billion) "
"this is also then an upper bound on the number of tables and indices in a "
"schema.  Whenever a database is opened, the entire schema is scanned and "
"parsed and a parse tree for the schema is held in memory.  That means that "
"database connection startup time and initial memory usage is proportional to "
"the size of the schema."
